# StructureFromMotionVisualizer
A basic prototype for a SfM reconstruction visualizer, where user can click on loaded camera positions to compare the reconstruction to the captured images

A 3D reconstructed mesh can be imported,  together with the calculated camera position, orientations and settings. The model and camera position can be freely explored in 3D

Other controls:
1. Right Mouse button - rotate around the object
2. Middle mouse button - zoom in and zoom out
3. Left mouse button - select camera to look through
4. Escape button - get out of camera view
5. Z button - show image used for SfM reconstruction from the selected camera position
6. X button - show 3D mesh on top of image to compare between image and resultant reconstruction
